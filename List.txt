# true: in order to use long doubles. This is slower, but generally more accurate, since we can use tolerances down to 10^-11 (or below that). 
# false: in order to use doubles. This is faster. However the tolerances of the ODE solver cannt be below 1e-8.

# Rosenbrock method. RODASPR2 is fairly accurate and fast enough (faster than the other two from NaBBODES), but one use the others or provide another Butcher tableu and use it.
