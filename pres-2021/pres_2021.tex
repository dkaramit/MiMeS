%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Initial conditions}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	%
	Some time at the very early Universe, $\maT \ll H(T)$,~\footnote{\fontF This is an assumption that \mimes has to make, for the sake of generality.} with
	\begin{equation*}
		\ddot{\theta}  + 3H \ \dot{\theta} \approx 0 \;.
	\end{equation*}	
	%
	The solution is 
	$$
	\theta = \thetai + C \dint_{0}^t d t' \ \lrb{ \dfrac{a(t'=0)}{a(t')} }^3 \;.
	$$
	%this is true especially in the case where the PQ symmetry breakes before inflation.
	So, $\dot{\theta} \sim a^{-3}$. Since we are interested in $\theta$ at much later times (once the potential becomes relevant), $\dot{\theta} \approx 0$.~\footnote{\fontF Standard misalignment mechanism. For the kinetic one see
	%
	\bl{\fontF R.~T.~Co, L.~J.~Hall and K.~Harigaya,
		\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.251802}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{124} (2020) no.25, 251802}

		\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03677}{[arXiv:2111.03677 [hep-ph]]} }.	
	}
	%
	Therefore, we can start integration at some point ($t=\ti$) with $3H \gg \maT$, and set $\theta(t=\ti) = \thetai$ and $\dot \theta(t=\ti) = 0$. 

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{(Bad) Analytical approximations}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	Once we agree on the initial conditions, we move to the next important things:\pause
	%	
	%\begin{equation*}
	%	\ddot \theta + \underbrace{  \bl{ 3\overbrace{H(t) }^{\text{Slow}}  } \ \dot \theta + \bl{ \overbrace{\maT^2(t)}^{\text{Slow}}  }}_{\maT > 3 H} \ \rd{\underbrace{ \sin \theta(t) }_{\theta \ll 1}  } = 0 \; ,
	%\end{equation*}	
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assume $\theta \ll 1$, and linearise the EOM. {\sl Not always that bad.}\pause
		\item Assume that at $\maT(\Tosc) \approx 3H(\Tosc)$, the oscillations begin with $\dot\theta(\Tosc)=0$. {\sl This is in general quite bad.}\pause
		\item Assume that $\thetaosc \approx \thetai$. {\sl Generally quite bad.}\pause
	\end{itemize}
	
	Then, we get the ``WKB"-approximate solution
	%
	\begin{equation*}\vspace*{-0.2cm}
	\theta(t) \approx \thetai \lrb{\dfrac{3}{4}}^{1/4} \sqrt{ \dfrac{ \maT(\Tosc) }{\maT(T)} } \lrb{\dfrac{a}{\aosc}}^{-3/2} \  \cos\lrb{ \int_{\tosc}^t d t^\prime  \ \maT(t^\prime)}   \;.
	\end{equation*}
	
	The advantage of this approximation is that we get an easy formula for the axion/ALP energy density today:
	%
	\begin{equation*}\vspace*{-0.2cm}		
		\rho_{a,0} = \gamma^{-1}  \dfrac{s_0}{s_{\rm osc}} \  \dfrac{1 }{2}  \ \fa^2 \ \ma \ \maT_{,{\rm osc}} \ \thetai^2    \;,
	\end{equation*}
	%
	where $\gamma$ the amount of entropy injection between $\Tosc$ and today.~\footnote{\fontF Defined from $s(T_0) = \gamma \ \aosc^3 \ s_{\rm osc}$.}

\subsection{Need for accuracy, speed, and automation}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	%
	Serious disadvantages of the approximate results:
	% 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The approximations can be tested against numerical results in a case-by-case basis; there is no way to tell if they will work in new models and cosmological scenarios.
		\item There is no available tool that can help us reproduce published results obtained by numerical integration; people use their own {\bf \em private} code. %peer-review process?
		\item If someone wants to simply see if an ALP model is compatible with a cosmological scenario, they have to develop their own private code; the overall effort of the community increases.
	\end{itemize}

	\mimes:
	% 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\sl Easy} to use; anyone can run it and see if their model can work.
		\item Reasonably fast; less than $0.05 \; s$ for the scenarios tested.
		\item Tools that can help determine if the algorithm is accurate enough.
		\item The user provides too much input. This helps the user determine is the convergence of the algorithm is consistent.

\section{\mimes}
\subsection{What {\em is} \mimes?}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
%
From the software point of view:\pause
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \mimes is a \CPP header-only library that contains various templated classes; there is no ``installation" and no special procedures, just include the header files. \pause
	%
	\item \mimes comes with a \PY interface so that everybody can use it.\pause
	%
	\item \mimes is distributed under the MIT license; you can do whatever you want with it, and I am {\em not} responsible.\pause
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\mimes: under the hood}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	%
	\mimes relies on \cppin{NaBBODES}~\footnote{\fontF \href{https://github.com/dkaramit/NaBBODES}{https://github.com/dkaramit/NaBBODES}.} for the numerical integration, and \cppin{SimpleSplines}~\footnote{\fontF \href{https://github.com/dkaramit/SimpleSplines}{https://github.com/dkaramit/SimpleSplines}.} for the various interpolations.\\[0.3cm] 
	
	Advantages:
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You only need to have the standard \CPP library.
		\item The two libraries are developed by myself, so their integration with \mimes is seamless.
		\item There is always going to be a compatible version of these libraries that works with \mimes.\\[0.3cm]
	\end{itemize}	
	
	Disadvantages:
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item These are not well tested libraries.
		\item No community of contributors; if it doesn't work, I have to fix it.
		\item Slow development.
	\end{itemize}	

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\mimes: Notation}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	%
	\vspace{-0.2cm}
	\mimes uses a notation suitable (any) underlying cosmology, since it is up to the user to define the cosmological evolution.	
	First, we define 
	\begin{equation*}\vspace{-0.2cm}
		u \equiv \log \lrb{a/\ai}\;,
	\end{equation*} 
	%
	with $\ai$ some initial value of the scale factor.~\footnote{\fontF Only the ratios $a/\ai$ appear in the calculations. So, the choice does not matter as long as it is consistent.} in order to express the time derivatives as 
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\dfrac{d  }{dt}  \to  H  \dfrac{d }{du} \;, 
		 \quad
		\dfrac{d^2 }{dt^2}  \to H^2 \ \lrb{ \dfrac{d^2 }{du^2} + \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{d \log H^2}{du}  \dfrac{d }{du} }\;.
	\end{equation*}
	%
	Then, we express the EOM as a system of first order ordinary differential equations
	%
	\begin{eqnarray*}\vspace*{-0.5cm}
		& \dfrac{d  \zeta}{du} + \lrsb{\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{d \log H^2}{du} + 3 } \zeta + \ \lrb{\dfrac{\maT}{H}}^2 \ \sin \theta
		=0 \;. \\[-0.2cm]
		&\dfrac{d \theta}{d u} - \zeta=0 \;.
	\end{eqnarray*}\\[-0.2cm]
	%
	Observe that, by definition, $\zeta = d\theta / du$. The initial conditions are $\zeta(0)=0$ and $\theta(0)=\thetai$.
	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\mimes: When do you start and stop integrating?}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	%
	The choice of a good starting point is important, as need to start at a temperature where $\zeta=0$ is a good approximation. So you can start at some $\Ti$ with a given ratio $3H(\Ti)/\maT(\Ti) \gg 1$.  This needs to be chosen carefully, as low values of $3H(\Ti)/\maT(\Ti)$ result in inaccurate result, while high values may result in a slow calculation. {\sl Advice}: Use various values of that ratio, and find where the relic abundance becomes $\Ti$-independent.\\[0.5cm]
	
	The stopping condition is more difficult. You should stop at some point where the axion/ALP evolves "adiabatically". Find a quantity that becomes constant as the system relaxes, and use this to determine when adiabaticity is reached. Once $\theta$ starts to evolve adiabatically, the amplitude of its oscillation is known at later times!
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\mimes: Some (classical) physics}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsectionhead}
	%
	If a system exhibits closed orbits, the quantity
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		J \equiv C \ \oint p \ d \theta \;,
	\end{equation*}
	%
	is the adiabatic invariant. In this case, it becomes
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		J = a^3 \ \maT \ \thetamax^2  \, f(\thetamax)  \;,
	\end{equation*}
	%
	with 
	\begin{equation*}
		f(\thetamax) =\dfrac{ 2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi \thetamax^2 } \dint_{- \thetamax}^{\thetamax} d \theta \sqrt{ \cos \theta - \cos \thetamax } \;,
	\end{equation*}
	 %
	 the so-called anharmonic factor.\pause
		 
	\textbf{Important}: $\thetamax$ is the peak of the oscillation. So, $J$ can be used to determine how $\thetamax$ changes with time. By definition, at $\theta=\thetamax$, $p \sim \dot \theta = 0$.
	This means that we can find $\rho_{a,0}$ on the peak of today's $\theta$, as
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\rho_{a,0} = \gamma^{-1} \ \dfrac{s_0}{s_*} \ \ma \ \maT_{,*} \ \dfrac{1}{2} \ \fa^2 \ \thetamax_{,*}^2 \;  \ f(\thetamax_{,*}) \;,
	\end{equation*}
	%
	where $T_{*}$ the temperature at which adiabaticity was reached, and $\gamma$ the entropy injection between $T_*$ and today (\ie $s_0 = \gamma a_*^3 s_*$). 	  
\end{frame}

\section{Using \mimes}

\subsection{How to get \mimes}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsectionhead}
	There are several ways you can get a stable version of \mimes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		%
		\item \cppin{git clone -b stable https://github.com/dkaramit/MiMeS.git}. This is the preferred way, as it is guaranteed to be the latest stable version.
		%
		\item Go to \href{https://mimes.hepforge.org/downloads}{mimes.hepforge.org/downloads}, and download it. 
		%
		\item Go to \href{https://github.com/dkaramit/MiMeS/releases}{github.com/dkaramit/MiMeS/releases}, and download a released version.    
	\end{enumerate}

	
	You can get the most up-to-date code -- not always the most stable one -- including the latest version of {\tt NaBBODES} and {\tt SimpleSplines}, by running
	%
	\begin{lstlisting}
		git clone https://github.com/dkaramit/MiMeS.git
		cd MiMeS
		git submodule init
		git submodule update --remote
	\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Configure (and make)}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsectionhead}
	There is no need to install anything if you are going to use \mimes in a \CPP program. The only thing you {\em must} do is run 
	\begin{bash}
		bash configure.sh
	\end{bash}
